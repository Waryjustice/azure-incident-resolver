I'm in the Azure incident resolver directory. Let me explore the codebase to understand how to work with this incident.

I need to understand what you'd like me to do with the incident ID `INC-20260214124102`. This appears to be an Azure Incident Resolver system with detection, diagnosis, resolution, and communication agents. 

Could you clarify what action you want me to take? For example:
- Investigate/diagnose this incident?
- Run a specific incident scenario?
- Check incident status?
- View incident logs or details?
- Execute a resolution workflow?

Without more context about what the incident is or what's expected, I want to make sure I take the right action.
