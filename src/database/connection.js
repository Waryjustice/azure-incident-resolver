I'm ready to help with the azure-incident-resolver repository. I see you've provided an incident ID: **INC-20260214125045**.

What would you like me to do? For example:
- Investigate or resolve this incident?
- Create incident documentation?
- Add incident tracking?
- Run diagnostics or tests?
- Something else?

Please provide more details about what action you'd like me to take.
