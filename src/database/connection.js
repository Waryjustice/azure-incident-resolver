I'm ready to help! However, I don't see a specific task in your message. Could you please provide details about what you'd like me to do with the `azure-incident-resolver` repository?

For example:
- Fix a bug or issue
- Implement a new feature
- Update documentation
- Run tests or builds
- Make code changes
- Something else?

Please describe what you need, and I'll get started right away.
